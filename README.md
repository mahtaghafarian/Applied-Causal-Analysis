## Applied Causal Analysis – Observational Data

This repository documents applied data analysis and causal inference work
using large administrative and environmental datasets.

### Problem
Estimating the causal effect of air pollution on outcomes using observational data.
In air pollution studies one important step is addressing the existing endogeneities in air pollution.

### Data
Satellite-based data on PM2.5
Environmental controls
Temperature data
Administrative outcome data

### Approach
Panel data methods with fixed effects
Two-Stage Least Square (2SLS) method

### Practical Focus
Addressing endogeneities through the application of the instrumental variables
### Note
Due to data confidentiality, raw data and executable code are not shared.
This repository documents methodology and analytical workflow.
